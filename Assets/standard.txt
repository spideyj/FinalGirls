My week has been really good! I'm taking some interesting classes, I adopted a really cute dog from the shelter and I was able to help a student with her problems.

#SAY.FlowchartLaurie.10.Laurie is thinking...
I feel a little guilty talking about how good my life has been when I know some of the others are having a tough time, but maybe it's as important to talk about the good times as the bad.

So I'm wrapping up that class I'm taking in another week or two.

#SAY.FlowchartLaurie.19.Carrie
This is the one you needed to take to keep up your teaching credential, yeah?

#SAY.FlowchartLaurie.20.Laurie
Yeah, that's right. Sometimes they end up being pretty terrible and boring, but this one is actually pretty interesting, I think.

#SAY.FlowchartLaurie.21.Mary
What's it about?

#SAY.FlowchartLaurie.22.Laurie
It's about the effects of trauma on learning. So you can see why it would be personally relevant.

#SAY.FlowchartLaurie.23.Ellen
{i}Ellen smiles.{/i}
Oh yes, I can see that. Have you talked about any of your experiences in the context of the class?

#SAY.FlowchartLaurie.24.Laurie is thinking...
It's always so hard to talk about my own trauma in a professional context. I worry about how it might change how people see me if they know what I went through.

#SAY.FlowchartLaurie.25.Laurie
Yes, actually, I ended up writing about it for our most recent assignment. That was kind of hard but ultimately helpful, I think?

#SAY.FlowchartLaurie.26.Jay
Oh yeah, I can imagine.

#SAY.FlowchartLaurie.27.Ellen
How did the instructor respond?

#SAY.FlowchartLaurie.28.Laurie
She was really positive and supportive. She thanked me for sharing something so personal and said that she imagined it was probably difficult to talk about.

#SAY.FlowchartLaurie.29.Laurie
She also said she thought my experiences would make me better at supporting any of my students who had been traumatized because I would be able to relate to them.

#SAY.FlowchartLaurie.30.Ellen
That's definitely been true for me in my work. But it's important to keep in mind that you will have to do extra work to take care of yourself.

#SAY.FlowchartLaurie.31.Ellen
While it can be very healing to connect with people who share those experiences with you, it can also be really exhausting and sometimes triggering.

#SAY.FlowchartLaurie.32.Laurie

Work was good, though we're approaching the end of the semester so some of my students are feeling pretty stressed out.

#SAY.FlowchartLaurie.39.Laurie
They're going to be turning in their papers soon so I'm going to be in grading hell for a bit.

#SAY.FlowchartLaurie.40.Jay

#SAY.FlowchartLaurie.41.Laurie
I let them choose two of the books we read this semester to compare and discuss how they connected with the themes.

{i}Laurie smiles.{/i}

#SAY.FlowchartLaurie.75.Mary
What kind of dog is he? Did you get him from the shelter?

#SAY.FlowchartLaurie.76.Laurie
Yeah, he's a rescue dog. Some kind of corgi mix. Whatever he is, he's really cute and very high energy! I hope he settles down when he gets a little older.

#SAY.FlowchartLaurie.77.Ellen
You had a dog before, right?

#SAY.FlowchartLaurie.78.Laurie is thinking...
I still miss Olive. I wasn't sure about getting another dog after she died, but now I'm glad I did.

#SAY.FlowchartLaurie.79.Laurie
Yes, her name was Olive. I still miss her, but I think it was time.

#SAY.FlowchartLaurie.80.Jay
What's the new puppy's name?

#SAY.FlowchartLaurie.81.Laurie
Oh! I almost forgot to tell you! I named him Bugsy because he gets really excited whenever he sees a bug. He is a mighty fly hunter!

{i}Laurie smiles.{/i}

#SAY.FlowchartLaurie.15.Ellen
Whatever feels comfortable, Laurie. I'm glad to hear your week went well.

#SAY.FlowchartLaurie.53.Laurie
One of my students came to me with a problem she's dealing with.

#SAY.FlowchartLaurie.54.Carrie
Oh? What happened?

#SAY.FlowchartLaurie.55.Laurie
Oh, it's terrible! She's being bullied by some of the other girls; they wrote some really nasty stuff about her on the walls of one of the girls' bathrooms.

#SAY.FlowchartLaurie.56.Jay
Ugh, that's awful. What did you tell her?

#SAY.FlowchartLaurie.57.Laurie
Well, it's hard, you know? I tried to encourage her to go to the administration about it but she said that would make it worse, which is probably true, unfortunately.

#SAY.FlowchartLaurie.58.Laurie
I also talked to her about talking to the girls who were doing it but it doesn't sound like that was a good option either.

#SAY.FlowchartLaurie.59.Laurie
I also offered to talk to them myself, and she said she would think about it. Mostly I just listened and told her that what they were doing wasn't right and she doesn't deserve it.

#SAY.FlowchartLaurie.60.Carrie is thinking...
I wish I'd had a teacher like Laurie when I was in high school...

#SAY.FlowchartLaurie.61.Carrie
I hope it doesn't get any worse for her.

#SAY.FlowchartLaurie.62.Laurie
Yeah, me too. If it continues I'm going to see if we can talk about going to mediation or something.

#SAY.FlowchartLaurie.63.Laurie
I'm considering reaching out to the other girls' parents to see what's going on there, hopefully without tipping them off that she came to me.

#SAY.FlowchartLaurie.64.Laurie
She and I are also going to meet with her counselor this week to discuss the situation.

Oh, you know, up and down... just your average week for someone with PTSD.

#SAY.FlowchartJay.7.Jay is thinking...
Actually, this week was really stressful. I had a complete meltdown and I feel really bad about it.

#SAY.FlowchartJay.5.Jay is thinking...
I at least got some writing done, I could talk about that. Otherwise there was that stupid movie and everything that followed, yuck.

Nice! How did it go?

#SAY.FlowchartJay.15.Mary is thinking...
I hope her date is a lot more genuine than Richard turned out to be...

#SAY.FlowchartJay.17.Jay
At first it was pretty great. We went to dinner and had a nice conversation.

#SAY.FlowchartJay.18.Jay
But things went kind of sideways when we got to the movie.

#SAY.FlowchartJay.20.Jay is thinking...
I really wish I had looked up the movie before we went...

#SAY.FlowchartJay.22.Mary
Uh oh... what happened?

#SAY.FlowchartJay.23.Jay
We went to see IT PURSUES.

#SAY.FlowchartJay.24.Carrie
{i}Carrie looks puzzled.{/i}

#SAY.FlowchartJay.25.Laurie
Oh no!

#SAY.FlowchartJay.26.Jay
Um... it turns out that movie is way too reminiscent of my stalker experience.

#SAY.FlowchartJay.27.Jay
So I ended up telling Nate that I wasn't feeling well partway through the movie and asking if we could leave.

#SAY.FlowchartJay.29.Ellen
How did he take it?

#SAY.FlowchartJay.30.Jay
Honestly, I think he was probably pretty annoyed, though he didn't show it.

#SAY.FlowchartJay.31.Jay
Especially when I told him I just wanted to go home, I couldn't bring myself to tell him what was going on.

#SAY.FlowchartJay.32.Laurie
Yeah, it's always really hard to figure out who you can trust with these kinds of things.

#SAY.FlowchartJay.33.Jay
Yeah, I dunno... 
What do you think? Should I have explained it?

#SAY.FlowchartJay.34.Jay is thinking...
I think it would have been really awkward, we only just met... and I was a terrible weepy mess when I finally got home.

#MENU.FlowchartJay.37
I think you should tell him.

#MENU.FlowchartJay.38
No, it's too soon to talk about it

#SAY.FlowchartJay.115.Jay
Despite everything else that went on, I did manage to get some writing done. I feel pretty good about that.

#SAY.FlowchartJay.117.Ellen
That's great! Do you want to tell us about it?

#SAY.FlowchartJay.118.Jay
Okay, but let me know if I'm starting to ramble. I sometimes don't notice until it's too late that people's eyes are glazing over.

#SAY.FlowchartJay.119.Carrie
I think it's fascinating! You're so creative, it always impresses me.

#SAY.FlowchartJay.120.Jay
{i}Jay blushes.{/i}
Thank you, that's really kind.

#SAY.FlowchartJay.121.Mary
It's the truth though!

#SAY.FlowchartJay.122.Laurie
Yes, I'm really curious. And I think I might have missed you talking about it last time because I had a scheduling conflict. Do you mind telling us again what you're working on?

#SAY.FlowchartJay.123.Jay
Well, it's a science fiction novel, about a woman who's the pilot of s ship on a scouting mission. The rest of the crew are in cryo-sleep and the ship's AI wakes her in intervals to check on their course.

#SAY.FlowchartJay.125.Jay
A lot of it is just her talking to the AI and thinking about a lover she left behind. I'm not going to spoil it but one of the questions left unanswered through most of the story is why.

#SAY.FlowchartJay.126.Jay
This week I ended up writing a particularly emotional passage talking about her previous relationships. It was oddly soothing, after the rest of the stress of the week.

#SAY.FlowchartJay.127.Carrie
I can't wait to read it.

#SAY.FlowchartJay.128.Mary
Neither can I!

#SAY.FlowchartJay.129.Jay

#SAY.FlowchartJay.140.Jay
There was this thing that happened that just freaked me out and I felt awful for days afterwards.

#SAY.FlowchartJay.142.Jay
I just felt so completely stressed out and anxious, like I was dealing with that stalker again. I couldn't bring myself to go out or anything.

#SAY.FlowchartJay.144.Jay
Thankfully I had food in the house, though I mostly didn't feel like eating either. But I totally would have starved rather than go out.

#SAY.FlowchartJay.143.Jay
I had really bad nightmares too.

#SAY.FlowchartJay.148.Mary
I still have terrible nightmares, all the time. Sometimes they're so bad that all I can do after I wake up is lie in bed all day feeling bad.

#SAY.FlowchartJay.149.Jay
Does it ever get any better?

#SAY.FlowchartJay.150.Ellen
Yes and no. It never goes away completely, but it gets easier. It happens less often and you start to recover more quickly.

#SAY.FlowchartJay.151.Jay
Ugh, I wish it would go away forever.

#SAY.FlowchartJay.152.Carrie
Yeah, I getcha. I wish that too... but it's not something you should be down on yourself for. And it definitely does get easier.

I'm pretty sure I couldn't have dealt with him freaking out about it though.

#SAY.FlowchartJay.44.Carrie
Yeah, I don't think there's any reason you should have told him immediately.

#SAY.FlowchartJay.45.Ellen
What do you think about following up with him now that you've had some time to think about it?

#SAY.FlowchartJay.46.Jay
Yeah, I was thinking about sending him an email.

#SAY.FlowchartJay.47.Jay is thinking...
It's so hard to figure out how much to say and how to say it. Guys freak out a lot of the time when I tell them what happened to me.

#SAY.FlowchartJay.48.Jay
But it's really hard! What if he freaks out about it like the last guy did?

#SAY.FlowchartJay.49.Mary
Better to find out sooner than later, in my opinion.

I don't know if you told us about this last week, but I'm really curious about how this all got set up...

Well, I gave her a list of my clients who expressed interest in being her subjects.

Then she emailed them a list of interview questions, and after they responded to that, she set up a time to photograph them.

He said he felt sort of pressured to come, like it was a homework assignment or something.

#SAY.FlowchartMary.199.Mary is thinking...
That made me really mad... I don't know how I even continued the conversation with him at that point!

#SAY.FlowchartMary.135.Mary
And then he told me that I couldn't expect him to be there for everything just because he's my boyfriend.

#SAY.FlowchartMary.130.Mary
And that if I was going to be upset and disappointed every time he didn't show up for something, this wasn't going to work out.

I was also really worried about how the show would be received. A lot of people really don't like my work and say terrible things about me and my clients.

#SAY.FlowchartMary.107.Mary
It's really hard to just ignore that, you know? And I wasn't wrong, we did get some of that feedback... but overall the reception was really positive, I think.

You had a show this week, right, Mary? How did it go?

#SAY.FlowchartCarrie.21.Ellen
That's great! Did you have a lot of events this week? Or just one big one?

#SAY.FlowchartCarrie.22.Carrie
I had a wedding and a couple of smaller events, so it was really hectic!

#SAY.FlowchartCarrie.23.Carrie
I had to hire staff for the wedding too, which I've only done a few times before, but it mostly worked out fine.

#SAY.FlowchartCarrie.24.Mary
Mostly?

#SAY.FlowchartCarrie.25.Carrie
Well, the groom turned out to be really finicky, but no one had said anything to me about it beforehand, so I had to put together something special for him at the last minute.

#SAY.FlowchartCarrie.26.Carrie
The bride was really apologetic, poor thing. I felt kind of sorry for her. But I think he was mollified eventually.

#SAY.FlowchartCarrie.27.Laurie
And the other events? How did they turn out?

#SAY.FlowchartCarrie.28.Carrie
Oh, they were fine. Mostly the usual business dinners and lunches, fairly standard.

#SAY.FlowchartCarrie.80.Carrie
Who knew that all that cooking I was doing to self soothe would eventually turn into a career for me?

#SAY.FlowchartCarrie.81.Ellen
That must feel really good.

#SAY.FlowchartCarrie.82.Carrie
Yeah, it does. I feel really proud of myself that it's working out so far. It's not easy! But I'm really enjoying it.

Things are pretty good, though we're still adjusting to living together.

#SAY.FlowchartCarrie.38.Laurie
Oh, that's right! You just moved in together, didn't you? How long ago was that?

#SAY.FlowchartCarrie.39.Carrie
It's been a couple of weeks now. I mean, we've been dating for a couple of years so I think we were in agreement that the time was right.

#SAY.FlowchartCarrie.40.Carrie
But you never know what it's really like until it becomes a reality.

Despite everything being so hectic, I managed to add a few more plants to the garden.

#SAY.FlowchartCarrie.74.Mary
Nice! I have such a black thumb, it's really great to hear not everyone does!

#SAY.FlowchartCarrie.75.Laurie
What kind of plants?

#SAY.FlowchartCarrie.77.Carrie
Well, I got some heirloom tomatoes and a few more herbs. I'm still not quite sure about the ph of the soil there, but we'll see.

#SAY.FlowchartCarrie.78.Laurie
Do you have any decorative plants or are you focusing on things you can eat?

#SAY.FlowchartCarrie.79.Carrie
Mostly things we can eat, for now. It was my love of cooking and wanting to have fresh herbs on hand that motivated me to try my hand at gardening in the first place.

#SAY.FlowchartCarrie.83.Carrie
But if the kitchen garden does well, I might think about planting something ornamental.

That's so fantastic.

#SAY.FlowchartCarrie.13.Ellen
[Whatever feels comfortable, Laurie. I'm glad to hear your week went well.]

#SAY.FlowchartCarrie.47.Carrie is thinking...
Oh what the hell, might as well talk about it.

#SAY.FlowchartCarrie.48.Carrie
We did have a silly petty fight. Promise me y'all won't laugh, okay?

#SAY.FlowchartCarrie.49.Mary
{i}Mary laughs.{/i}
Oh, c'mon! We all know how dumb fights happen in every relationship.

#SAY.FlowchartCarrie.50.Laurie
Yeah, it's pretty normal.
{i}Laurie smiles.{/i}

#SAY.FlowchartCarrie.51.Carrie
Okay, fine. But I still feel silly about it, because in retrospect it was just ridiculous.

#SAY.FlowchartCarrie.52.Carrie is thinking...
I'm sure it didn't help that I was really tired after the wedding and still a little irritated about trying to get that groom fed.

#SAY.FlowchartCarrie.55.Carrie
I'd just gotten home and she asked me about the soap dispenser in the guest bathroom. She had a pretty nice one that I put in our bathroom so I put my old one in the guest bathroom.

#SAY.FlowchartCarrie.57.Carrie
But I'd totally forgotten about it, so at first I had no idea what she was talking about. I thought my old one was still in our bathroom and that was what she was angry about.

#SAY.FlowchartCarrie.58.Ellen
Was she angry?

#SAY.FlowchartCarrie.59.Carrie
No, though I thought she was because she seemed sort of brusque. She told me later that she had been writing all day so her head was still half in Writer Land, so that was why it seemed that way to me.

#SAY.FlowchartCarrie.60.Carrie
I don't think I'd really spent much time around her when she'd been writing before - she'd usually take time to transition out of writing headspace before we'd get together.

#SAY.FlowchartCarrie.61.Carrie
Anyway, I snapped at her - I don't remember exactly what I said now - and then she started crying, which took me by surprise. I felt awful!

#SAY.FlowchartCarrie.62.Jay
Oh no! Then what happened?

#SAY.FlowchartCarrie.63.Carrie
Nothing really. I apologized and we explained what was going on with each of us and then we kissed and made up.

#SAY.FlowchartCarrie.64.Laurie
Aww, that's really sweet.

#SAY.FlowchartCarrie.65.Ellen
{i}Ellen smiles.{/i}
It sounds like you resolved it pretty quickly.

#SAY.FlowchartCarrie.66.Carrie
Yeah, I just felt silly for being snippy with her, and really surprised that she got so upset right away. But I understood it after she explained.

#SAY.FlowchartCarrie.67.Ellen
Yeah, those sorts of minor conflicts are to be expected when you adjust to a new level of commitment and intimacy.

#SAY.FlowchartCarrie.68.Carrie
{i}Carrie nods.{/i}

#SAY.FlowchartCarrie.69.Carrie is thinking...
I'm glad it was over so quickly. In the early days of our relationship, something like that would have probably led to us fighting for hours...

I was thinking that to wrap up, we could talk about our self care strategies. How does that sound?

#SAY.FlowchartEnd.27.Mary
Sounds good to me.

#SAY.FlowchartEnd.28.Ellen
How about you, Carrie, would you mind starting us off by telling us about what kinds of things work for you?

#SAY.FlowchartEnd.29.Carrie
Sure, though I'm in kind of a weird place right now around that. Cooking was a big form of self care for me, but now that I've got the catering business, it's not quite the same.

#SAY.FlowchartEnd.30.Carrie
That is why I started the garden, though; I thought it might be a good substitute. We'll see though, it's still a very new thing.

#SAY.FlowchartEnd.31.Ellen
Yes, I can see how that might be a challenge. Anyone else? Jay, how about you?

#SAY.FlowchartEnd.32.Jay
I go running, sometimes, though it's hard when my anxiety makes it difficult to leave the house.

#SAY.FlowchartEnd.33.Jay
Writing is a big one for me - I keep a journal, but working on my novel helps too, sometimes.

#SAY.FlowchartEnd.36.Laurie
Work sometimes helps. Grading papers can be monotonous but it's also soothing. Otherwise, I like to do my nails and watch cartoons.

#SAY.FlowchartEnd.37.Jay
Cartoons? That's pretty cool.

#SAY.FlowchartEnd.38.Laurie
Yeah, I really like the old Disney animated movies or Animaniacs. Anything light and silly makes me feel better.

#SAY.FlowchartEnd.43.Laurie
Walking Bugsy or playing with him also helps, he really brightens my days.
{i}Laurie smiles.{/i}

#SAY.FlowchartEnd.39.Ellen
What about you, Mary? What works for you?

#SAY.FlowchartEnd.40.Mary
Reading old medical texts. Going to the gym. Shopping for new clothes also works sometimes.

#SAY.FlowchartEnd.41.Mary
I have friends that I talk to also - some of them are clients who I've known since before I was attacked, so I don't have to explain anything to them, just tell them I'm having a hard time.

#SAY.FlowchartEnd.44.Ellen
Yes, reaching out to get support from people in our lives can be really important.
{i}Everyone nods.{/i}

Well, our time is just about up. Have a good week, everyone, and thank you for coming.

Jay's story can be difficult to read - she had an experience that was deeply evocative of her trauma and so she had a difficult week. But she's learning to work through it and take care of herself just like you are.
